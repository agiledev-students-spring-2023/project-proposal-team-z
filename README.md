### Project title

NYUThrift

### What and why?

A online-commerce platform for NYU students to sell used items like textbooks, furniture, and clothes. Selling and buying used goods online can involve extra shipping fees as well as a possbility of being scammed. Our app will allow users to sell their products to a more trusted user-base (NYU students). 

### For whom?

NYU Students 

### How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

An eccomerce platform that allows people to list items and has a search feature that allows people to sort by categories. 

### Scope

We are essentially building an online fourm where people can find and discover products they want to buy. So we think it is reasonable to impelement for 4-6 poeple in a semester.
